Supervised Machine Learning: Classification Analysis.

The aim of the following project is to study what factors affect the likelihood of a customer subscribing to the newly launched cross-sell promotion of an (anonymous) meal kit delivery company.

In order to establish that, this document will cover: 
(1) Initial Exploration of Dataset, 
(2) Feature Engineering, 
(3) Model Preparation, 
(4) Model Development and Variable Selection, and 
(5) Model Comparison and Selection.  

Actionable insights into how to increase the likelihood of a customer to subscribe include:
- The greater the flexiility a customer has to cancel orders AND the more time they spend watching meal prep videos, the more likely said customer will be to subscribe to the cross-sell promotion.
This suggests targetting those customers who, on average, show a tendency to buy those meal kits that require longer prep video times, as well as keeping cancellation timeframes as wide as possible
and making the process to cancel an order easy for the customer (the greater the flexibility to cancel, the lower the buyer's remorse and the more likely they will be to commit to a subscription promotion).
- On the other hand, the data shows that those subscribing with an email domain included in the following list tend to diminish this likelihood of subscription to the promotion:
"me.com", "aol.com", "hotmail.com", "live.com", "msn.com", "passport.com". This group of customers has been classified during the analysis as using a "junk email", which they might have employed to sign up using a "welcome" coupon
and then might have unsubscribed once they had to start paying full-price for the meal kit boxes again.
- The likelihood of subscription is also lowered for those customers whose deliveries arrive early, which might make sense considering the target market for this company (9-to-5 workers who might not be at home
during the morning).
